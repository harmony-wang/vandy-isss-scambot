Common Types of ScamsImpersonating Government Officials or Agencies: Calls from someone pretending to be from DHS, ICE, USCIS,  the IRS or other government agency. They may threaten deportation or say you are involved in a criminal investigation and the only remedy is providing payments via wire transfer, gift cards, or other electronic means.Housing/Rental Scams: Luxury units at “too good to be true” rents, asking for deposits to be paid before viewing the place in person only to discovers the unit does not exist. Paying deposits before viewing a property and then not hearing from the landlord again.Employment Offer Scams: Receiving job offers for which you did not apply; requesting deposits for job related materials or equipment prior to starting; emails about employment opportunities that offer good pay for very little work/time. Companies asking for personal or bank information for direct deposit when you have not applied for or accepted a job.Social Media/Online Gaming Scams: Calls or messages threatening to post indecent images on social media; hacking of Venmo or other electronic payment accounts;
