Key Scam IndicatorsScam Indicators:
Urgency: Messages pressuring for immediate action (e.g., "act now or lose the opportunity").
Too-good-to-be-true offers: Promises of rewards, large sums of money, or services with minimal effort or payment.
Requests for personal information: Asking for sensitive details like bank info, passwords, or Social Security numbers.
Suspicious links or attachments: Including links that the user is unfamiliar with or attachments in unsolicited emails.
Unfamiliar senders: Communication from unknown individuals or companies with whom the user has no prior contact.
Threats: Threatening consequences if immediate action is not taken (e.g., account suspension, legal trouble).
Unverifiable or inconsistent information: Mismatched details, spelling errors, or strange email domains.

More scam indicators:
There is a demand for personal information, money, or gift cards.
The scammer creates a sense of urgency and uses high pressure tactics to get you to comply quickly.
The scammer tries to isolate you. They tell you that you cannot hang up and cannot talk to anyone else.
Scammers use threats: threats of humiliation, threats of deportation, or other threats to your legal status or wellbeing of your loved ones.
The situation or offer seems too good to be true. For example, a luxury apartment with very low rent or a job offer you never applied for.
Scammers may contact you via email, text, phone or social media.
